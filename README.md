# Anomaly Detection System for Security Logs

# Overview
This project is an Anomaly Detection System designed to detect unusual patterns or anomalies in security logs that could indicate potential security threats or breaches. The system is built using Python and leverages machine learning techniques to differentiate between normal and suspicious activities.

# Features
- **Data Simulation**: Generates synthetic security logs with both normal and anomalous behavior.
- **Machine Learning Model**: Implements an Isolation Forest model for detecting anomalies.
- **Real-time Detection**: A Flask API is provided for real-time anomaly detection.
- **Containerization**: The project is containerized using Docker for easy deployment.
- **CI/CD Integration**: GitHub Actions is used for continuous integration and deployment.

# Getting Started
